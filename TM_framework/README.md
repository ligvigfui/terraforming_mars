# The goal of this project is to have an extensible, maintainable, fast implementation of Terraforming Mars.

## extensibility
- Custom card packs can be loaded from the `cards` directory.
    - Packs do not bend the rules of the base game but have a bit of flexibility.
- Mods can be added to the `mods` directory.
    - Mods can change the rules of the game greatly.
