## Card distribution rules

### Limited variant

#### Bidding

Each player puts 1 or 2 of their markers on any card(s), or passes.
A player can have a maximum of 3 markers on a card
Each player can use a maximum of 15 markers in each bidding round.
Players can only place markers while they are able to pay for all of them!

#### Evaluation (distribution) of the cards

Start evaluating from the card with the most total markers on it to the card with the least markers

1. In reading order
2. From right to left
3. From top to bottom

In case of a tie

1. The player with fewer cards in front of them has priority
2. The player sitting closer to the first player in the round has priority
3. If a card has no markers, it is immediately placed on the discard pile

#### Paying for the bid

Every project card that a player wins and takes in front of them must be paid for in the amount of markers placed on it by the bid winning player.
Example: Anne has 2, Bill has 1 marker on the first card. At the start of [evaluation](#evaluation-distribution-of-the-cards) Anne takes the card in front of her, pays her 2 markers, and returns Bill's marker

#### Recieving cards

##### Company / Prelude cards

Choose 1 / 2 card(s) respectively from the cards in front of you and pay your bids reduced by 1 per card.

###### Example

- Anne got 2 Companies. She must choose one (since you have one company) and discard the other.
- After recieving the money from the Company starting amount she pais the amount (3M€) she won the bids with reduced by 2 (1 for each Company) for a total of 1M€.

##### Project cards

players can buy every card in front of them for 2M€ each

##### Other changes

The effect of the Terralab company is supplemented as follows:
"When you take a card in front of you, pay one less for your bid."

### Unlimited variant

#### Bidding

We start bidding the cards layed out one by one.
The first player starts the bid with 0 or a higher number
The bid goes in the same direction as the turns
Either you raise or you pass
If everyone has passed, the winner takes the card after paying the bid
We pass on the starting player card.
