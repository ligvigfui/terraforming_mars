## Card distribution rules

### Bidding

- Going in rounds
- Each player
    1. Puts 1 or 2 of their markers on any card(s), or passes for the remainder of this bidding round.
    2. Can have a maximum of 3 markers on a card
    3. Can use a maximum of 15 markers in each bidding round.
    4. Can only place markers while they are able to pay for all of them!

### Evaluation (distribution) of the cards

1. Start evaluating from the card with the most total markers on it to the card with the least markers
    1. In reading order
    2. From right to left
    3. From top to bottom
2. In case of a tie
    1. The player with fewer cards in front of them has priority
    2. The player sitting closer to the first player in the round has priority
    3. If a card has no markers, it is immediately placed on the discard pile

### Paying for the bid

1. Every project card that a player wins and takes in front of them must be paid for in the amount of markers placed on it by the bid winning player.
2. Example
    - Anne has 2, Bill has 1 marker on the first card.
    - At the start of [evaluation](#evaluation-distribution-of-the-cards) Anne takes the card in front of her
    - pays her 2 markers
    - returns Bill's marker

### Recieving cards

1. Company / Prelude cards
    - Choose 1 / 2 card(s) respectively from the cards in front of you and pay your bids reduced by 1 per card.
2. Project cards
    - Players can buy every card in front of them for 2M€ each

Example:

- Anne got 2 Companies. She must choose one (since you have one company) and discard the other.
- After recieving the money from the Company starting amount she pais the amount (3M€) she won the bids with reduced by 2 (1 for each Company) for a total of 1M€.

## Other changes

- The effect of the Terralab company is supplemented as follows: "When you take a card in front of you, pay one less for your bid."
