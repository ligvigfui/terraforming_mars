|--------------|---------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Player*4 Project | Project | Project cards | No |

### Bidding

- Going in rounds
- Each player can
    1. put 1 or 2 of their markers on any card(s), or pass for the remainder of this bidding round.
    2. have a maximum of 3 markers on a card
    3. use a maximum of 15 markers in each bidding round.
    4. only place markers while they are able to pay for all of them!

### Evaluation (distribution) of the cards

- Start evaluating
    1. From the card with the most amount of total markers on it to the card with the least markers
    2. In reading order
        1. From left to right
        2. From top to bottom
- Giving the card to
    1. The player with fewer cards in front of them
    2. If tied to the player sitting closer to the first player in the round
- If a card has no markers, it is immediately placed on the discard pile

### Paying for the bid

1. Every project card that a player wins and takes in front of them must be paid for in the amount of markers placed on it by the bid winning player.

### Recieving cards

1. Company / Prelude cards
    - Choose 1 / 2 card(s) respectively from the cards in front of you and pay your bids reduced by 1 per card.
2. Project cards
    - Players can buy each card in front of them for 2M€

## Other changes

- The effect of the Terralab company is supplemented as follows: "When you take a card in front of you, pay one less for your bid."

Example:

- Anne got 2 Companies. She must choose one (since you have one company) and discard the other.
- After recieving the money from the Company starting amount she pais the amount (3M€) she won the bids with reduced by 2 (1 for each Company) for a total of 1M€.

2. Example
    - Anne has 2, Bill has 1 marker on the first card.
    - At the start of [evaluation](#evaluation-distribution-of-the-cards) Anne takes the card in front of her
    - pays her 2 markers
    - returns Bill's marker
