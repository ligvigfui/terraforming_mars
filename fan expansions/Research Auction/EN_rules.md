## Card distribution rules

### Limited variant

#### Bidding

    1. Each player puts 1 or 2 of their markers on any card(s), or passes.
    2. A player can have a maximum of 3 markers on a card
    3. Each player can use a maximum of 15 markers in each bidding round.
    4. Players can only place markers while they are able to pay for all of them!

#### Evaluation (distribution) of the cards

    1. Start evaluating from the card with the most total markers on it to the card with the least markers
    2. In reading order
        1. from right to left
        2. from top to bottom
    3. In case of a tie
        1. The player with fewer cards in front of them has priority
        2. the player sitting closer to the first player in the round has priority
    4. If a card has no markers, it is immediately placed on the discard pile

#### Paying for the bid

    1. Every project card that a player wins and takes in front of them must be paid for in the amount of markers placed on it by the bid winning player.
    2. Example: Anne has 2, Bill has 1 marker on the first card. At the start of [evaluation](#evaluation-distribution-of-the-cards) Anne takes the card in front of her, pays her 2 markers, and returns Bill's marker

#### Recieving the cards

    1. In case of Company / Prelude cards: Choose 1 / 2 card(s) respectively from the cards in front of you and pay your bids reduced by 1 per card.
        1. Example Anne got 2 Companies. She must choose one (since you have one company) and discard the other.
        2. After recieving the money from the Company starting amount she pais the amount (3M€) she won the bids with reduced by 2 (1 for each Company) for a total of 1M€.
    2. In case of Project cards: players can buy every card in front of them for 2M€ each
        1. The effect of the Terralab company is supplemented as follows:
        "When you take a card in front of you, pay one less for your bid."

### Unlimited variant

#### Bidding

    1. We start bidding the cards layed out one by one.
    2. The first player starts the bid with 0 or a higher number
    3. The bid goes in the same direction as the turns
        1. Either you raise or you pass
    4. If everyone has passed, the winner takes the card after paying the bid
    5. We pass on the starting player card.

#### If all cards have been dealt

    1. In case of Company or Prelude cards: Choose the limit amount of cards from the cards in front of you
    2. In case of Company or Project cards: players can buy every card in front of them for 2M€ each
        1. The effect of the Terralab company is supplemented as follows:
        "When you bid on a card, pay one less for it."
