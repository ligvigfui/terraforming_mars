    2. Once everyone has run out of 15 markers or passed, we distribute the project cards
        1. From the card with the most total markers to the card with the least markers
        2. In reading order
            1. from right to left

            1. The player with fewer cards in front of them has priority
            2. the player sitting closer to the first player in the round has priority
        4. If the winning player does not have enough money, we remove their remaining markers from the cards and evaluate the given card according to point 2.
        5. If a card has no markers, it is immediately placed on the discard pile
    3. Every project card that a player takes in front of them must be paid for in the amount of markers placed on it by the bid winning player.
        1. Example: Anne has 2, Bill has 1 marker on the first card. At the start of 3.2 Anne takes the card in front of her, pays her 2 markers, and returns Bill's marker
