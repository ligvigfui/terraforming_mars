### Bidding

- Going in rounds
- Each player can
    1. Put 1 or 2 of their markers on any card(s), or pass for the remainder of this bidding round.
    2. Have a maximum of 3 markers on a card
    3. Use a maximum of 15 markers in each bidding round.
    4. Only place markers while they are able to pay for all of them!

### Evaluation (distribution) of the cards

- Pick a card
    1. With the most amount of total markers on it, if tied
    2. In reading order
        1. From left to right
        2. From top to bottom
- Move the card in front of the player
    1. With the most amount of player markers on it, if tied
    2. With fewer cards in front of them, if tied
    3. Sitting closer to the first player in the round
- If a card has no markers, it is immediately discarded.

### Paying for the bid

- When a player wins a bid, they pay the amount of markers placed on the card by them.
- Then move the card in front of them.

### Recieving cards

| Card type | What to do |
|-----------|------------|
| Company | Choose 1 from the cards in front of you and pay your bids reduced by 1 per card in front of you. |
| Prelude | Choose 2 from the cards in front of you and pay your bids reduced by 1 per card in front of you. |
| Project | Buy any number of cards in front of you for 2Mâ‚¬ each |

## Other changes

- The effect of the Terralab company is supplemented as follows: "When you take a card in front of you, pay one less for your bid."
